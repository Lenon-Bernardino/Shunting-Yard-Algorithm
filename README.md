# Shunting-Yard-Algorithm
My own implementation of an algorithm called "Shunting Yard" for evaluating mathematical expressions in C++.

We can use the expression "4+18/(9−3)" as an example of how it works.

It parses that expression into reverse polish "4,18,9,3,−,/,+.".

Which is then evaluated in the following way:
